## 1.Proxy verification
- Whitelist your machine's IP
- Set the username and password when making a request (according to the request library settings used, the username and password used for proxy verification can be obtained on the order details page)

## 2.Command line test
If your program runs on Linux, we highly recommend that you test the availability of the proxy server through commands under the command line `curl`before programming.

> For example, your username is `username`, password is `password`, Proxy Host and Proxy Port are `0hmg5j581x.g.go2proxy.com:16888`

You can execute the following command to test the proxy availabilityï¼š
