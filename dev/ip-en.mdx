## 1.Management console settings
You can view and modify the current region and cycle configuration in the console [「My Orders」](https://www.go2proxy.com/console/orders). After the modification is successful, the change will take effect within one minute.

## 2.Encoding settings
- For example, use an IP in the New York area of the United States and set the IP replacement cycle to 1 minute.
- You can set it in the program in the following ways：
`{username}-region-{US}-area-{New York}-period-{1}:{password}`, fill in the user name, country code, area code, IP replacement cycle (minutes), and password. For example, username `gf2814951572`, password`aft415oyt`, used in this request`USA - New York area ip、The IP address replacement interval is 1 minute`。

```python code example
gf2814951572-region-US-area-New York-period-1:aft415oyt
```

<Note>When you set the region and cycle through coding, the system will ignore your region and cycle configuration in[「My Orders」](https://www.go2proxy.com/console/orders)in the console.</Note>
